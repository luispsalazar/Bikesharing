# Bikesharing, Module 14 Challenge

Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:
Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.


## Deliverable 1

The data in the "tripduration" column is converted to a datetime datatype and has the correct time format.

## Deliverable 2

A line graph displays the number of bikes checked out, by trip duration, for all users. The graph can be filtered by its duration, in hours.

A line graph displays the number of bikes that are checked out by duration for each gender, by the hour. The graph can be filtered by the hour and gender.
